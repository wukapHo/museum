# Museum Louvre

Implementation of the [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/xkP6mIaq7uG1Uru7CpasXq/Museum-04.09?node-id=0%3A1) from Figma. I used flexboxes, CSS-animation, integrated panoramas from google maps, add interactivity (handling user events), set adaptive and responsive through @media queries, and connect js-libraries.
